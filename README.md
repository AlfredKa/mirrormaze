# Outline

MirrorMaze is a captivating computer graphics mini-project that challenges players to navigate through a complex maze using mirrors as their primary tool. The game is built using a Python-based game engine (Godot) and focuses on the unique concept of reflection to guide the player to the exit. The challenge lies in mastering the art of reflection to avoid getting lost in the maze's intricate design. Each level presents increasingly complex mazes with more mirrors, obstacles, and unique puzzles. Players must plan their moves carefully, considering the angles of reflection and the interactions between multiple mirrors to unveil the correct path to the exit.
